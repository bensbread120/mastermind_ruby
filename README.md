create a game where the computer selects a random code of four digits each bewtween 0 and 5.
The user will then attempt to guess the code by inputing guesses into command line.
After each guess the program will compare the guess with the computers code and give feedback.
The feedback will be in the form of an X for a correct digit that is also in the right space, an O will be given for a correct digit in the wrong place.
If the digit guessed is not part of the computer code, then an underscore will be returned.
the user has 12 turns to guess the code, and will otherwise lose.

ie computer code = 1234

player guess = 1524
             =>X_OX
